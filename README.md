# Anti-Framework

### Ultramodern JavaScript Anti-Framework

Anti-Framework is a UI library that takes an anti approach to the nature of frameworks like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

- **No JSX**:Anti uses template-literals to define DOM nodes
- **No Virtual-DOM**: Anti does not use a VDOM, which means it can perform better
- **No compiler needed** 
- **No dependencies**
- **High performance**: ideal for mobile
- **Decoupled events**: Both delegated and direct event listeners are decoupled from the DOM 
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic and semantics are separated
- **Lightweight**: Less than 5kb minified
- **Minimalistic**
- **Scalable**: Solves real-world problems without inventing new ones
- **Easy customization**: Anti was made with the intention of forking and customization.  

## Hello World Example _(For the birds)_
```javascript
import { insertInto } from 'anti-framework'

const helloView = insertInto('#root', ({greeting}) => `<h1>${greeting}</h1>`)

helloView({greeting: 'Hello World!') // <div id="root"><h1>Hello World!</h1></div>
```
## Features 

### Logic-less Views
> Anti is a simple string-based DOM engine that uses template-literals for generating DOM nodes. The values you place inside template-literal placeholders `${}` will result into a string _(this is just standard JavaScript)_. Putting logic inside template-literal placeholders will cause a mess and break the semantic and visual nature of markup like HTML and SVG. Therefore all values are to be evaluated before being passed into a template function.

### Viewless Controllers
> Your components should be separated by view/s and controller _(files or directories)_. The logic of your components only reside in the controller module/s. Markup is not defined within the controller, only in the view. The controller should import view-functions to instantiate with required values.
You can also separate event logic into event _(files or directories) as an extension to your controller logic.

### Decoupled Events 
> Event-delegation should be the first desirable approach when managing events. But when this is not possible we must add event-listeners directly to non-global and non-top-level UI elements. Anti will remove events from descendents before they are written over to prevent memory-leaks. This allows us to completely decouple both delegated and direct events from our natural inclination of writing to the DOM.

### DRY Templates
> View-template are parametrised, meaning that they can take a variety of values for reuse without additional boilerplate code.
This is just one of the many benefits of logic-less views.

### Slats
> Slates are snapshots of changes to a particular selector. Slates can be optionally stored or ignored when making a change to the DOM.
They are stored as strings and can be modified as strings or elements. Each selector can have one slate which represents the last recorded change. 
This is useful for:
> - Preserving the integrity of the DOM: (A slate can be used to rectify a subtree that the user or a browser extension has modified) 
> - Security: To prevent modifying or reading dangerous changes made on the user's side
> - Last state modifications: To make modifications based on the last saved state

### Direct Modifications
> Because of Anti's event model, you can modify the DOM directly. This is ideal in places where the integrity of the DOM is relaxed (not data critical).
For data-critical UIs it is important to use the sanitiser before reading directly from the DOM.

### Sanitiser
> For safely reading directly from potentially dangerous parts of the DOM. This is your responsibility.

### String-based UI manipulation
> You will notice there are no APIs for manipulating data or control flow when rendering. This is because Anti is a string-based DOM engine.
Because JavaScript has very strong string manipulation capablities, this makes Anti the most powerful UI framework for manipulating DOM elements.

### No environment dependencies
> With Anti we are going back to the basics
> - Anti can work directly in the browser using the `<script...` tag
> - NPM usage is not mandatory
> - Bundlers are not mandatory
> - Babel and TypeScrpt are not needed 

## Support
