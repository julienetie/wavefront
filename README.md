# Wavefront

### The Anti-Framework (Work In Progress)

[![Standard-Js](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://standardjs.com/)

Wavefront is an ultramodern front-end JavaScript framework for building superlative user interfaces without the theatrics found in popular JavaScript frameworks.

### Not your grandma's JavaScript framework
We do things a little bit different here.


- **No JSX**: Wavefront uses template-literal strings to define DOM nodes
- **No Virtual-DOM**: Wavefront does not use a VDOM, it queries the DOM
- **No Compiler**:  The code you develop with is your source code 
- **No Dependencies**  
- **High Performance**: Over-engineering is the bane of front-end development 
- **Decoupled Events**: Delegated and direct events are decoupled from the DOM
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic and semantics are separated
- **Lightweight**: Less than 6kb minified
- **Minimalistic**
- **Scalable**: Solves real-world problems without inventing new ones
- **Easy Customization**: Fork and customize without losing sleep
